                <ul>
                    <li>Around 70% of the Earth's surface is covered by oceans.</li>
                    <li>Oceans cover three quarters of the Earth’s surface, contain 97 per cent of the Earth’s water, and represent 99 per cent of the living space on the planet by volume</li>
                    <li>Over three billion people depend on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihoods</li>
                    <li>Globally, the market value of marine and coastal resources and industries is estimated at $3 trillion per year or about 5 per cent of global GDP</li>
                    <li>Oceans contain nearly 200,000 identified species, but actual numbers may lie in the millions</li>
                    <li>Oceans absorb about 30 per cent of carbon dioxide produced by humans, buffering the impacts of global warming</li>
                    <li>Marine fisheries directly or indirectly employ over 200 million people</li>
                    <li>Subsidies for fishing are contributing to the rapid depletion of many fish species and are preventing efforts to save and restore global fisheries and related jobs, causing ocean fisheries to generate US$ 50 billion less per year than they could</li>
                    <li>As much as 40 per cent of the world oceans are heavily affected by human activities, including pollution, depleted fisheries, and loss of coastal habitats</li>
                </ul>
