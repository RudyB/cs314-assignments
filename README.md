# Assignment 1 - HTML Basics
Email to  dillonr@gonzaga.edu  due by 11:59PM Wednesday, Jan 31

1. If you don’t already have one, create a Github account. Once you create your account, make a new repository called ‘cs314-assignments’. This is where all of your assignments will go throughout the semester. For each new assignment, you will create a new branch with the instructed title. To get started, clone this new repository to your machine to begin development.

2. Once you have the repository on your machine, create a new branch from the master branch called ‘html-basics’.
a. “ git checkout -b html-basics “

3. Create an ‘index.html’ file using the template provided in class and on the class
webpage. You can focus it on some topic you’re interested in or just use dummy/placeholder text to include what is listed below. Whatever you decide, keep the content appropriate. Include at least one (1) of each of the following:

    a. ```<header>```   
    b. ```<h1>```   
    c. ```<p>```   
    d. ```<ol>``` with at least two (2) ```<li>```   
    e. ```<a>```   
    f. ```<img>```   
    g. ```<table>``` with a heading, some rows, and footer.   
    h. ```<footer>```   

4. Once you are finished with the assignment, you need to be sure to push your ‘html-basics’ branch to your repository. There are a few ways to do this, and a lot of documentation out there, but one example flow is below:

    a. “‘git status” - this shows you your current situation - what files have changed, what branch you are on, etc.   
    b. “git add .” - this adds all files that have been changed to be committed   
    c. “git commit -m ‘ place a message here that tells yourself what you did ’ “ - this commits your changes to the repository locally   
    d. “git push origin html-basics” - this will actually push your branch and changes to the main repository   
    e. Now you can check your repository in github and should see your new branch you are finished with the assignment, you need to be sure to push your with your index file    

5. Email me ( dillonr@gonzaga.edu ) an email with the subject “Github Repo”. In the body of that email, send me the link to your Github repository and project. For example, https://github.com/rileydillon/cs314-assignments.
